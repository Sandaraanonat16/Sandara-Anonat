<h3>Song Lyrics</h3>

    <ul> 
<br>
 <li>

[Verse 1:]<br>
Youll be safe in my romance, <br>
babe Labels fading
you<br>
But I see you cravin for more
Youre denying it
do <br>
But you aint controlling your actions
Keep me guessing
But dont keep me waiting for us .<br>
<span style = "color:#DA1884; font-weight:bold">I wrote this song for you</span>
<br>
<li>

[Chorus:] <br>
Oh I live to appreciate you<br>
Take all the love that I give
<br>
All that I wish is for you to take me
But I taste the lies on your lips<br>
<span style = "color:#DA1884; font-weight: bold"> Turn into something beautiful<br>
I count the days when we're in love
'Cuz I only matter when he's not around<br>
Oh but I live to appreciate you<br>
So take all the love that I give.
</span></li><br>
</li>
<br>
<li>

[Verse 2:]<br>
Got my heart on my sleeve<br>
I'm beggin' the heavens to be good to me
you<br>
Are you obsessive love?

do<br>
'Cuz I'm tolerating all of your desires
I'll keep you wanting me more oh<br>
Leave but I'll keep you comin'
I'm sure it's my love that got you suffocated
</span>
</li>
<br>
<li>
[Chorus:]<br>
Oh I live to appreciate you<br>
Take all the love that I give
All that I wish is for you to take me<br>
But I taste the lies on your lips
I count the days when we're in love
'Cuz I only matter when he's not around<br>
Oh but I live to appreciate you
So take all the love that I give.<br>
</span>

</li>
<br>
<li>
[Verse 3:]<br>
You come over but not too often
You don't visit 'cuz you got more options<br>
do</li><br>
